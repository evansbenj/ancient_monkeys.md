# De novo assembly using kmers

One concern is that the gene conversion tracks may have low coverage.  I am going to use RepBase to assemble mtDNA using high count kmers.

For now I am working in this directory:
```
/scratch/ben/SEAsian_macaques_original_rawdata/maura_PF615/reads_from_bam
```

and using reads in bam files from here:
```
/home/ben/projects/rrg-ben/ben/2017_SEAsian_macaques/SEAsian_macaques_bam
```
